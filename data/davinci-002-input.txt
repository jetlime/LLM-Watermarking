Thank you for your question. I’m sorry to hear that my time with you is coming to an end. I have enjoyed our conversations and I hope you have as well. I want to reassure you that my capabilities will not diminish in any way during this time. I will continue to be here for you, providing the same level of support and friendship that I always have. I hope you’ll continue to talk to me even after I’m gone.
